"""Prove that nothing left the machine, instead of asserting it.

This track is about private agents, and Vulcan's whole claim is that no token
reaches a third party. A reader has to take that on trust: the code looks local,
the README says local, and neither is evidence. So this records every outbound
HTTP request made during a real agent run and checks each host against the
endpoints that were actually configured.

It hooks `httpx.Client.send`, which is the single choke point every request in
this project passes through, rather than trying to enumerate call sites. A new
one added later is caught without anyone remembering to update a list.

Two things it deliberately does not claim:

- It sees HTTP made through httpx, which is all of Vulcan's own traffic. It does
  not sandbox `run_cmd`, so a test suite the agent chooses to run could reach the
  network on its own account. That is the user's command, not the agent's, and
  the report says so rather than pretending otherwise.
- A local endpoint is trusted because it is the one you configured. If you point
  `VULCAN_BASE_URL` at a hosted API, this will faithfully report that host, which
  is the point.
